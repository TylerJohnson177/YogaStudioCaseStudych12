        <h2>Relax Anytime with Savasna</h2>

        <p>
            Prepare yourself for Sanasna.  Lie down on your yoga mat with your arms at your side with your palms up.
            Close your eyes and breathe slowly but deeply.  Sink into the mat and let your worries slip away.  When you
            are ready, roll on your side and use your arms to push yourself to a sitting position with crossed legs.  Place
            your hands in a prayer position.  Be grateful for all that you have in life.  Namaste.
